Myles—this looks really great.

 

When you’re creating the specs, I’d appreciate if you could
include details on the image filter being used across all the cyan images, or
if possible even provide us the filter as an SVG.

 

I think we had briefly touched on the fonts in an earlier
call—what fonts are we looking at here, and have we already discussed how we’re
going to get them on the web?

 

Simran,

My first thought on these images is something like:

img.classWhenItsCyan {

    filter: sepia(1) hue-rotate(148deg);

}

But I actually think there’s something more complicated going on
there. Also I think the definition of “sepia” is left to the browser, so that
method might not produce good cross-browser consistency—definitely more to
explore here.

 

Best,
Dave
